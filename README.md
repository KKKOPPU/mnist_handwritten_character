# mnist_handwritten_character

The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

It is a dataset of english alphabets in the form of 28 x 28 pixel data of handwritten single characters between A to Z.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 26 classes representing integer values from A to Z, inclusively.

Added a tkinter GUI, which will populate a writing canvas, where a character between A - Z can be written (in live) and the predicted output digit is shown with % of accuracy.
